When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    Publishing a repository with source code for others to see and/or use is one reason to use a site like GitHub.
    Collaborating with others is another use case for a public remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If working with a set of code or a particular branch, you wouldn't want updates to automatically change or conflict with the work you are in the middle of.
    Manual control is maximum control.
