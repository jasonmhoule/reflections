What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git directory is created. This implements git config and tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is a subset of the working directory and not yet committed as the repo.
    It is helpful to flexibly organize files to be added to an upcoming commit.
