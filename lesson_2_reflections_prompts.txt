What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    A .git directory is created. This implements git config and tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is a subset of the working directory and not yet committed as the repo.
    It is helpful to flexibly organize files to be added to an upcoming commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    Using git diff --staged, one can see what changes will be committed across the repo.
    One can add to or remove from the staging area to ensure the commit is coherent.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

    Testing out new changes or versions. Collaborating on different parts of a corpus.
    Branches are organized "threads" of work that maintain history of changes as well as where these initiated from the "source of truth" copy.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    They show where branches break from one another, and reachability from each branch.
